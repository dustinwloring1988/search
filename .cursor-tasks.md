  - Run `npm init` to generate a `package.json` file.
  - Install core dependencies: Electron, TypeScript, and any Node packages needed.
- [x] **Set Up TypeScript**
  - Create a `tsconfig.json` with proper settings for Electron's main and renderer processes.

## 2. AI Integration and Semantic Querying

### Integration with ollama's API
- [ ] **Study and Implement the ollama API**
  - Review the [ollama API documentation](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md) to understand endpoints, parameters, and streaming options.
  - **Tool Used:** ollama API
    - *AI Usage:* The AI will send natural language queries to the API and process streaming responses.
- [ ] **Develop API Query Functions**
  - Create a TypeScript module for querying ollama.
    - Implement streaming support to receive incremental responses.
    - Include error handling (timeouts, network errors).
  - Write unit tests that send sample queries and verify structured responses.

### Semantic Query Handling
- [ ] **Natural Language Processing Module**
  - Create a module that accepts user questions.
  - Parse and preprocess the input before sending it to the AI.
  - **Tool Used:** ollama API with granite3.2-vision output formatting
    - *AI Usage:* The AI leverages natural language understanding to translate questions into structured commands that later drive tool invocations.
- [ ] **Error Management and Logging**
  - Integrate logging for API interactions.
  - Set up a retry mechanism for failed API requests.

## 3. Tool System Core Implementation

### Defining the Tool Interface and Command Structure
- [ ] **Design a Generic Tool Interface**
  - Create a TypeScript interface (e.g., `interface Tool { name: string; input: any; output: any; execute(): Promise<any>; }`).
  - Document the expected input format, output format, and error structure.
  - **Tool Used:** granite3.2-vision structured output
    - *AI Usage:* The AI generates commands that map directly to this interface so that each tool can be executed automatically.

### Dynamic Tool Loading and Registration
- [ ] **Implement a Dynamic Tool Loader**
  - Create a loader that scans a dedicated `tools/` directory for modules implementing the `Tool` interface.
  - Dynamically import and register these modules on app startup.
  - Write tests to ensure all tools are discovered and meet the interface requirements.

### Creating the executeTool Function
- [ ] **Develop a Centralized Tool Executor**
  - Build an `executeTool` function that:
    - Receives AI-generated structured commands.
    - Matches the command name to a corresponding tool.
    - Invokes the tool's `execute()` method with validated input parameters.
  - **Tool Used:** granite3.2-vision to translate AI instructions
    - *AI Usage:* The AI sends detailed, structured instructions (including which tool to invoke and with what parameters). The executor then logs and returns the tool's response.
- [ ] **Unit Testing for Tool Execution**
  - Write tests simulating multiple scenarios and edge cases (e.g., missing parameters, invalid commands).

## 4. GUI Development with Electron and Playwright

### Electron Application Framework
- [ ] **Set Up the Electron Main Process**
  - Create `main.ts` to initialize the app, manage windows, and handle lifecycle events.
  - Configure IPC (Inter-Process Communication) between main and renderer processes.
- [ ] **Develop the Renderer Process**
  - Create an `index.html` and corresponding `renderer.ts` to host the UI.
  - Ensure secure communication between processes (use context isolation and preload scripts as necessary).

### User Interface Layout
- [ ] **Design the Dual-Panel Interface**
  - **Left Panel: User Interaction**
    - Implement a text input area for users to type natural language questions.
    - Create an output area for displaying AI responses.
    - **Tool Used:** ollama API for fetching AI responses.
      - *AI Usage:* The AI processes input queries and returns both the answer and the structured plan.
  - [ ] **Right Panel: Step-by-Step Plan and Browser Preview**
    - Implement a panel that displays a step-by-step breakdown of tasks.
    - Integrate a live preview area where browser actions are visually represented.
    - **Tool Used:** Playwright for browser automation preview.
      - *AI Usage:* The AI's structured commands are converted into actionable steps that Playwright executes; live feedback (screenshots, state changes) is displayed in real time.

### Playwright Integration for Browser Automation
- [ ] **Set Up Playwright**
  - Install Playwright and configure basic browser automation.
  - Develop helper functions to perform common actions (e.g., click, type, screenshot).
- [ ] **Link AI Commands to Browser Actions**
  - Map specific AI-generated tool instructions (e.g., "click login button") to Playwright functions.
  - Implement a communication bridge between the tool system and the live browser preview.
  - **Tool Used:** Playwright and granite3.2-vision
    - *AI Usage:* The AI directs browser automation by issuing commands that are translated into Playwright actions; the output is shown on the right panel for user verification.

### User Experience Enhancements
- [ ] **Status and Error Indicators**
  - Build visual status indicators (loading spinners, success/error messages) for:
    - API calls.
    - Tool execution.
    - Browser actions.
- [ ] **Responsive Design and Feedback**
  - Optimize layout responsiveness.
  - Provide real-time feedback on actions (e.g., "typing in browser...", "screenshot captured").

## 5. Integration Testing and Debugging

### End-to-End Workflow Testing
- [ ] **Test Complete Interaction Flow**
  - Simulate a full cycle:
    - Natural language input → AI query via ollama → tool selection via granite3.2-vision → browser automation via Playwright.
  - Use automated testing frameworks (e.g., Jest, Mocha) to cover integration points.
- [ ] **Test AI Command Parsing**
  - Validate that AI-generated structured output correctly maps to tool commands.
  - Ensure all commands produce the expected browser actions.

### Logging, Monitoring, and Error Handling
- [ ] **Centralized Logging**
  - Implement logging for:
    - API requests/responses.
    - Tool execution details.
    - Browser automation events.
- [ ] **Robust Error Handling**
  - Add try-catch blocks and fallback mechanisms for:
    - Failed API calls.
    - Invalid tool commands.
    - Playwright action failures.
- [ ] **User Feedback and Debugging Tools**
  - Integrate an in-app debug console for live error reports.
  - Create a mechanism to send logs to an external service for post-mortem analysis if needed.

    - Each module's responsibilities (API integration, tool system, UI, browser automation).
    - Instructions for adding new tools (with examples).
  - **Tool Used:** Documentation generators (e.g., TypeDoc for TypeScript)

- [ ] **User Guides and FAQs**
  - Create a user manual that explains:
    - How to input natural language queries.
